* Third Party API Work Scheduler 

The goal of this assingment was to create a workday scheduler using html , css and JQuery. 

This assingment used local storage and moment js to create a 9-5 workday planner. 

* What i used 
- HTML 
- CSS 
- BootStrap 
- Javascript 
- Jquery 
- momnet JS 

* Overview 

I found this homework difficult as i am still trying to wrap my head around javascript. Therefore i did struggle with the JQuery elements. Unfortunetly, i am still stuck in tutorial mode. 

Where i cant really solve problems from scratch. I find i have to find similar examples via youtube and stack to create my assignments. Often i spend majority of the time trying to integrate the example to my current assignment. Although i am improving slowly i am still not at the level required for this course. 

My strategy moving forward is to practice solving javascript problems via edabit and hacker rank. Furthermore to attempt to add features to competed assingments.Im hopping that i can slowly put the peices together.
